<h1 align="center">FinaPlan</h1>

Financial planning using modules.

Inspired by [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy):

- Each module does exactly one thing and does it well;
- Modules are composed together and work together in a way that is defined by user;
- Modules handle simple streams of numbers ("cash flow")
